            While many singers would be thrilled for the opportunity to perform,
            it is an essential part of the career to ensure that they are not
            rushing to use their instrument too fast. In other words, several of
            the classic roles such as those of Verdi and Puccini require a
            certain level of vocal maturity in order to be performed well.
            Otherwise a singer might put theirself at risk of vocal injury if
            their body is not prepared to handle such repertoire. This is why
            knowing when and where to say "no" will be the most helpful tool to
            a singer. In addition to maturity, proper vocal technique is
            imperative to learn so that the larynx will remain low and relaxed,
            rather than tense which put the vocal folds at risk of experiencing
            disorders such as MTD - muscle tension dysphonia, vocal nodules,
            partial or full paralysis and vocal hemorrages. In doing so the
            power source is left to come from the diaphragm, intercostal muscles
            and pelvic floor muscles which are all responsible for proper breath
            control. Knowing this information of how to sing properly and know
            when to sing are the two most important decisions for a sustainable
            career.

            Many singers who also practice meditation have also received
            enormous benefits. This occurs since one of the main points is to
            focus on the breath and how they are experiencing the current
            moment. With all sorts of stressors in people's lives, finding a way
            to turn off their stress levels and create a safe environment
            physically, mentally and spiritually and be more productive outside
            of meditation.

            Along with mental health it is just as necessary to maintain
            physical health too. Eating a balanced nutritional diet will provide
            a singer with the fuel they need to thrive vocally. Today there is a
            higher likelyhood of a singer being cast if they stay in shape and
            are able to dance or move well onstage. This is because of the
            increased visual demand of audiences through the Met HD that are
            looking for a more visually entertaining production in addition to a
            wonderful sound.

            Lastly, if a singer's speaking voice uses the same instrument, it is
            important for a singer to treat this with the same respect as
            singing. Shouting, yelling or straining can all have excessive
            tension and negative results on the vocal chords. This is why
            singers must be aware of their surroundings and social situations
            when speaking. Breathiness, over pushing, or deepening are all ways
            a person can change the tone of their voices to communicate.
            Speaking resonantly and allowing the voice to naturally flow up and
            down is the healthiest and least demanding on the vocal folds.
            Therefore singers should be aware of this and remind themselves to
            speak comfortably and healthy for themselves and a prolonged career.
