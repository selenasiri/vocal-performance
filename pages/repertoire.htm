            The following are a list of songs and arias from the standard classical repertoire 
            that range from beginning to advanced difficulty levels. After working on these songs myself, 
            I have found that maintaining the appropriate repertoire can help a singer 
            keep their voice on track! Just as an athlete must continue to stretch and exercise 
            on a regular basis, singers must treat their instruments in the same respect. Many pieces 
            on this list can also be adjusted to suit the singer's natural 'tessitura', or in other words 
            it is the pitch range where it is the most comfortable to sing.
