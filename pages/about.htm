            Selena Siri was first introduced to opera at the age of seventeen
            when her voice teacher suggested that her voice was better suited to
            this style rather than musical theatre. Even though her heart had
            been attached to musical theatre styles of singing, she also knew
            that the biggest strength of her voice was her top register.
            Following this advice she continued to receive her bachelor’s degree
            from Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University where she
            was taught ear training, music theory, music history, movement and
            other areas in the world of opera.
            <br />

            "Over time I found that classical music could be just as enjoyable
            as pop or contemporary music. This was especially true if I overcame
            language barriers to make it more easily understood. After learning
            Mandarin in Beijing from the “Shui Li Fang” Chinese pop competition
            I felt eager to learn more foreign languages. In college I took
            language courses up to Advanced Italian Conversation and Fundamental
            French in order to get a grasp of the diction and culture. These
            skills have benefited me through summer programs in ‘The Greek Opera
            Studio’ where I sang Barbarina (Le nozze di Figaro) and The New York
            Lyric Opera’ where I reprised the opera in the role of Susanna."
            <br />
            <br />
            "Now as a member of the New York Singing Teachers Association I am
            continuing my vocal studies through seminars. I also feel an
            enormous duty to give back and extend my knowledge to my students in
            private piano and singing lessons. Through teaching contemporary and
            classical styles of music, I hope that I can share this passion with
            others and teach others to perform each role with justice. At the
            end of the day it is about telling a story that will benefit others.
