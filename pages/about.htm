            I was first introduced to opera at the age of seventeen when my
            voice teacher suggested that my voice was better suited to this
            style rather than musical theatre. Even though my heart had been
            attached to musical theatre styles of singing, I also knew that the
            biggest strength in my voice was the top range of my voice.
            Following this advice I continued to receive my bachelor’s degree
            from Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University where I was
            taught ear training, music theory, music history, movement and other
            areas linked to opera.
            <br />
            <br />
            Over time I found that classical music could be just as enjoyable as
            pop or contemporary music. This was especially true if I overcame
            language barriers to make it more easily understood. After learning
            Mandarin in Beijing from the “Shui Li Fang” Chinese pop competition
            I felt eager to learn more foreign languages. In college I took
            language courses up to Advanced Italian Conversation and Fundamental
            French in order to get a grasp of the diction and culture. These
            skills have benefited me through summer programs in ‘The Greek Opera
            Studio’ where I sang Barbarina (Le nozze di Figaro) and The New York
            Lyric Opera’ where I sang Susanna (Le nozze).
            <br />
            <br />
            Now as a member of the New York Singing Teachers Association I am
            continuing my vocal studies through seminars. I also feel an
            enormous duty to give back and extend my knowledge to my students in
            private piano and singing lessons. Through teaching contemporary and
            classical styles of music, I hope that I can share this passion with
            others and teach others to perform each role with justice. At the
            end of the day it is about telling a story that will benefit others.
