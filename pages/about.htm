            "I found myself questioning whether musical theater was really the
            best place for me. My voice coach at that time, Mona Greenberg of
            Manalapan, had introduced me to some classical soprano pieces, which
            she felt would highlight my strengths. Those pieces, sung in
            Italian, grew on me, and friends and family also began to notice how
            well they suited my voice. I began to realize that even within
            musical theater the songs I loved the most were what I consider
            “legit styled” works, such as Christine from
            <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>. Then, with little time to spare, I let
            my parents know that I decided to apply to programs in classical
            vocal performance instead."

            As a recent graduate of Mason Gross School of the Arts Rutgers
            University, Siri has studied Vocal Performance (B.M.). Previous
            engagements with the New York Lyric Opera include the role of
            Susanna (Le nozze di Figaro), Barbarina (Le nozze di Figaro), and
            teaching private singing lessons as an apprentice teacher with the
            New York Singing Teachers' Association. She was also a finalist in
            the Beijing "Shui Li Fang Bei" Mandarin pop singing competition in
            2015, which can be viewed on her website

            along with other recent performances. In addition to her music, she
            continues to search for new ways to display "truthful, living art"
            along with technology. She is currently pursuing courses in HTML,
            CSS and Javascript alongside singing to reach a wider audience and
            improve upon web designing.

            In addition to voice performance, Siri has been teaching private
            singing lessons as an apprentice teacher with the New York Singing
            Teachers' Association. This has taken place since October 2018. She
            strongly believes that in order to hold strong teaching skills a
            teacher must whole-heartedly comprehend the knowledge they are
            handing down to the student. Just as a student who is furtherdown
            the road of education, she has gained an immense amount of
            satisfaction from continuing her studies on how to properly teach
            the voice. This was through vocal pedagogy courses that overlaped
            topics in anatomy and physiology, psychology, and social pressures
            that can all influence one’s sound quality. On the side, Siri is
            passionate about animal rights and is an activist for Anonymous for
            the Voiceless. The organization was a movement promoting a vegan
            diet to end world suffering. She also participates with the Curvy
            Girls group that stands up for those living with scoliosis. She
            looks forward to continuing her journey with activism and helping
            others find their voice. It is her goal to use all these possible
            ways of communication to continue influencing her students and
            community for deeper understandings and a better lifestyle.
